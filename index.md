### Prologue

These course notes are developed for the students of Spacecraft Dynamics and Control (AER506) based on
the following resources:

- *AER506 Course Notes*, C. J. Damaren, University of Toronto, Fall 2015

- *AER506 Notes*, based on lectures by G. M. T. D’Eleuterio, University of Toronto, Fall 2013

- *Spacecraft Dynamics and Control: an Introduction*, A. H. J. de Ruiter, C. J. Damaren, J. R. Forbes; Wiley, 2013

- *Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics*, P. C. Hughes; Dover, 2004

- *Space Vehicle Dynamics and Control*, B. Wie; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1998

These notes are meant as a supplement and not a substitute for the lectures. They do not include examples 
or tutorial problems discussed in class, nor do they elaborate on the concepts as much as the lectures are
intended to do. They also make occasional references to the course’s required and recommended textbooks
(the third and fourth items in the list above, respectively), and hence are not self-contained. It is hoped,
nevertheless, that the students will find them useful for preparing for each lecture beforehand, for facilitating
their in-class note-taking, and for reviewing the key concepts as the course progresses.
